## Arrays primer

- Arrays offer contiguous storage that enables O(1) random access but requires careful index management to avoid bounds errors.
- Prefix/suffix sweeps, hash maps, and sorting unlock many counting and optimisation tricks on arrays.
- Look for opportunities to compress stateâ€”two-pointer passes, rolling products, or maintaining running extrema keep solutions
linear.
- When a task asks for reconstruction, ensure the output ordering satisfies the stated constraints before coding the template.
