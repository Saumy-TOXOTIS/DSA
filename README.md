# 🚀 DSA Practice Hub | Saumy's Code Playground 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to my personal space for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository is my journey of solving problems, implementing algorithms from scratch, and building a strong foundation for competitive programming and technical interviews.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository is organized by topics. Here's what you'll find inside:

*   📂 **Arrays/Algorithms**: Core array manipulations and fundamental algorithms.
*   🔍 **Binary Search**: Solutions based on the powerful binary search technique.
*   🧠 **Dynamic Programming**: Tackling complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
*   🕸️ **Graph**: Implementations of graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.
*   🔄 **Recursion**: Solving problems using the magic of recursion and backtracking.
*   📊 **Sorting Algorithms**: Classic sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
*   🌳 **Trie**: Problems involving this special tree-based data structure.
*   👉 **Two Pointers and Sliding Window**: Efficient techniques for array and string problems.
